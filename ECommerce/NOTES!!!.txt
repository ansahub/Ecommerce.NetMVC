Check if user is Admin -> condition. 
If normal user dont display categorylist link thus not see Add category (html)
Condition also in the Controller otherwise user can write url to reach the page

So to be able to create category I need to login with Admin user 

Admin

Användare 1
user@one.com User1!

Användare 2
user@two.com User2!

TODO✓
